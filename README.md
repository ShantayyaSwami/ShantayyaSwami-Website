# DOCKER 

The repository is part of my journey towards the docker 

In this, I have developed the docker image for my website and pushed it on the docker hub.

# Pull the image
    docker pull shantayyaswami/shantayyawebsite:latest
 
# Run the below command
    docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 --name=shantayya-website shantayyaswami/shantayyawebsite:latest
    
# You should see output like below
